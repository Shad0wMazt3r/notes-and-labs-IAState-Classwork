# Introduction


### Wireless Network
- Computer connected to a router without physical / wire
- Allows for mobility of devices 

### Wireless Security
- Attackers may hack PC and steal private data or use the devices
    - Stepping stone / botnet
- Reading wireless data (sniffing)



### Wireless Communications
- Risks
    - No link using Radio waves
        - Antenna (transmitter)
        - Reciever antenna get current from waves
        - Could also be light or sound
    - Uni and Omni directional
        - Omni is broadcast in all directions
        - Uni is specific one direction
            - Send only to where it is needed 


### Radio Propogation
- Ideal
    - No obstacles 
- Real
    - Obstacles
    - Reflection, diffraction, and scattering
        - Distorations, fades, and errors in signal


### Types
- Cellular
- WLAN
- MANET (Mobile ad hoc Network)
- Sensor Networks (IoT)
- Wireless Mesh Networks
- PAN (Bluetooth and Zigbee)
- VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Network)


### NIST Evaluations for Wireless
- Any Vulnerability in wired is present in wireless
- New ones as we have new protocols and are more public
- Recommendations
    - Disable file sharing
    - Turn off Apps when not in use
    - Good password
    - Audit
    - VPNs are good (on unencrypted traffic)
