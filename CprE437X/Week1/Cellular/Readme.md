# Cellular

### Network
- Frequency is limited so we have to reuse it several places
- Dive towers into coverage area 
- Can't put same frequency close to each other

### Wide Coverage
- Number of users per tower is limited by channels 
- Still server many at once
- Costly


### Handoff 
- Transition of a mobile user from one base station to another
    - Travels from one tower to another
- May cause drops if new tower not available
