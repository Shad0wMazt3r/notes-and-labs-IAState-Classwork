- How are we using resources that are limited?

### FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Split into multiple Frequencies
- These are each a channel that one user can use at one time
- TV channel is given own frequency

### TDM (Time-division multiplexing)
- Split into multiple timings that designate a channel
- At certain time we open up channel for certain user
- Scheduling shows on television (single channel)

### FDMA (Frequency-division multiple access)
- FDMA is the division of each bandwidth (RX,TX) into many frequency bands (channels)
- Each frequency swaps users by time
- Multiple television channels spliting by shows that have set time

### TDMA (Time-division multiple access)
- It allows several users to share the same radio frequency (RF) by dividing it into different timeslots
- Seems same as TDM just by the other view of it
    - Not fixed if being used (give it to another user)
    - TDM is fixed assignment
- Sending packets (Round robin)


### TDMA over FDMA
- TDMA with many frequencies



### Modes of transmission
- Simplex communication system
    - One way from tx to rx
- Half Duplex communication system
    - Two-way communication on the same channel
    - At any given time a user can only transmit or receive
    - Same channel for tx and rx so both can tx at same time (interfere)
- Full Duplex communication system
    - simultaneous two-way communication
    - Two simultaneous but separate channels are provided for communication to and from the terminals


### Why Mobile and Wireless
    - Largest software-hardware-networked systems
    - Dominate Internet
    - New possibilities == new threats
    - Integrated to people

### Mobile and Wireless
- Mobile
    - Users can use network services while moving
