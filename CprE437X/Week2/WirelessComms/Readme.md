# Wireless Communications

- How are we using resources that are limited?

### FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Split into multiple Frequencies
- These are each a channel that one user can use at one time
- TV channel is given own frequency

### TDM (Time-division multiplexing)
- Split into multiple timings that designate a channel
- At certain time we open up channel for certain user
- Scheduling shows on television (single channel)

### FDMA (Frequency-division multiple access)
- FDMA is the division of each bandwidth (RX,TX) into many frequency bands (channels)
- Each frequency swaps users by time
- Multiple television channels spliting by shows that have set time

### TDMA (Time-division multiple access)
- It allows several users to share the same radio frequency (RF) by dividing it into different timeslots
- Seems same as TDM just by the other view of it
    - Not fixed if being used (give it to another user)
    - TDM is fixed assignment
- Sending packets (Round robin)


### TDMA over FDMA
- TDMA with many frequencies



### Modes of transmission
- Simplex communication system
    - One way from tx to rx
- Half Duplex communication system
    - Two-way communication on the same channel
    - At any given time a user can only transmit or receive
    - Same channel for tx and rx so both can tx at same time (interfere)
- Full Duplex communication system
    - simultaneous two-way communication
    - Two simultaneous but separate channels are provided for communication to and from the terminals


### Why Mobile and Wireless
    - Largest software-hardware-networked systems
    - Dominate Internet
    - New possibilities == new threats
    - Integrated to people

### Mobile and Wireless
- Mobile
    - Users can use network services while moving
    - Point of attachment to network is router/AP
- Wireless
    - Communicate without using a wire
        - Directly between nodes 
        - Or between node and AP to AP an second node
- Networking
    - Protocols and algorithms enabling communication
        - Link layer (MAC)
        - Network
        - Transport


### Different in Wireless networks
- High loss rates (collision or interference)
- Restrictive spection regulations (country or scarcity)
- Low transmission rates
- Higher delay
- Lower security
- Shared and unbounded medium
- Mobility
    - Change point of attachment
    - Finding a user
- Limitation of access devices (power)


### Current Tech
- Telecomm
- WLAN (802.11)
- WPAN (Bluetooth and Zigbee)
- Satellite


### Licensed vs Unlicensed 
- Mobile cellular is licensed
    - GSM, UTMS (3G)
    - LTE (4G)
- WLAN and WPAN are unlicensed
    - 2.4GHz
        - 11b/g
        - bluetooth and zigbee
    - 5 GHZ
        - 11a/n/ac/ax


### Why Insecure
- Channel broadcasts comms
    - Eavesdropping, jamming and open to attacks
- Mobility == not physically secured
- Resources == Limited memory and processing resources
- Accessibility == unattended


### Extra

- Wireless transceivers
    - Base stations (BS) 
    - Access points (AP) 
    - Mobile stations (MS)
- Spectrum
    - Frequency bands for uplink and downlink
    - Air interface
- Management Entities
    - Mobility management
    - Power management
    - Radio resource management
    - Security
- Deployment
    - Frequency reuse
    - Network design
