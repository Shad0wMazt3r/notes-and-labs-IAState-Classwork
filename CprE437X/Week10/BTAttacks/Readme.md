# Bluetooth Attacks


### Bluesnarfing
- theft of information from a wireless device through Bluetooth
- Exploiting a vulnerability in the way Bluetooth is implemented
    - an attacker can access information
        - the user's calendar, e‐mail, and text messages 
    - without leaving any evidence of the attack
- Other devices that use Bluetooth, such as laptop computers, may also be vulnerable
    - although to a less extent, by virtue of their more complex systems

- Operating in invisible mode protects some devices
    - you are still vulnerable as long as Bluetooth is enabled


### BlueJacking
- sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth
- Both parties remain in absolute control over their devices 
    - Not hijacking
- technically harmless
- Send messages, images, video, or sound


### Bluetapping
- Eavesdropping on bluetooth links
    - Not secured
    - Listen between phone and headset from a mileaway
- Tracking people


### Why use bluetooth over infrared?
_ Infrared issues
    - Intended for p2p links
    - **Line of sight**
    - Low power and throughput
    - Very low range
    - Low compatability

### Bluetooth advantages
- Wireless (No Cables)
- No Complex Setup Needed
- Low Power Consumption (1 mW)
- Industry Wide Support
- Multi‐point connectivity: Bluetooth allows for multiple devices connectivity
- Convenience: Bluetooth technology enables hands‐free communication and control


### Disadvantages
- No integrity checks
- No prevention of replay attacks
- Man in the middle attacks
- Sometimes: default = no security
- Fairly Expensive
- Low throughput rates (up to 24 Mbps)
- Interference

### Application Security
- Bluetooth also includes application‐level security protocols, such as:
    - Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)
    - Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)
    - Those protocols provide additional security features for specific types of applications.
- Security levels for services
    - authorization required
    - authentication required
    - encryption required
- Different or higher security requirements could be added:
    - Public key


### Future of Bluetooth
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Bluetooth Increased Range (up to 100 m)
- Bluetooth Improved Data Transfer
- Bluetooth Improved Security
- Bluetooth ISM interference/Interoperability
- Bluetooth Local Positioning

- Some of these are completed (I think)
