### Review

![review](./review.png)



### ROC Curve
- Reciever operating characterisc curve
- 2 ways it is shown
    - y axis == 1-FRR and x axis == FAR
    - y axis == FAR and x axis == FRR

- Set multiple thresholds and learn FAR and FRR for each threshold
- Graph the FAR and FRR together for each threshold (one graph)


### Base Rate
- What percent of events do you wish to detect?
- Number of events that should be detected OVER Total Events
- Feature of the envirnment
    - Where you put the system
- TCP connection example
    - Base rates is low (very few are attacks)
- Biometric examples
    - Base rate is high
