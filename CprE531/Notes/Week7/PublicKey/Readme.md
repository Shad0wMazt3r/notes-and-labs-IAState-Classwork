### Hard problems
- Discrete log is exponential
- Factoring large number


### "Factoring"
- n == p * q 
    - where p and q are prime
    - Roughly same size
- find p and q given n
    - go through every number
    - First factor you find is smallest of p and q
    - Slow as hell


### RSA
- Public Key crypto
- (e, n) is publc key
- (d, n) is private key
