# Adversarial Thinking

Thinking like an attacker

### What is it?
- Adversarial thinking
    - mindset where you think about how someone could disrupt, damage or make unusable a system or process
- Often think about non malicious threats (weather ... power outages)
    - SRE does this
    - These events can be used to carry out other attacks
    - What about malicious threats carried out by a determined adversary
    - Physical access (throughout history)
    - Cyber enabled access (newest threat vector)
- We need to approach our solutions asking, **“What if an adversary had access?”**
    - Then what changes could we make to make it harder for the adversary to be successful
- ***We need to think like the adversaries***


### Historic Defense

- Primary Defense systems
- 1990s
    - Firewalls – 1980s
    - Encryption WW2
    - Detection  IDS – 1985
    - Secure OS – Secure Unix late 1980s
    - User awareness mid 1990s
- Today
    - Minor Improvements on these
    - Nothing much new


### What changed in 30 years
- More  attackers
- More possible devices (over 30 billion)
- More motivations to attack ($, IP, war)
- More reliance on technology and the Internet
- More potential victims (users on the net)
- More DATA to steal



### What is our risk?
- We don’t know how important something is until we lose it.
- We don’t always know what is important to others (customers, attackers)
- We need to look at:
    - What are the targets
    - What are the threats
- Example
    - State wants all government devices with full disk encryption
    - Risks / Costs
        - Not all devices supported at the time
        - Devices without sensitive information don't need it
            - Thinclient or Test machines that are flashed often

### Why Adversarial Thinking?
- Cyber offense is always easier than cyber defense
    - Defense must always be right
    - Defense cannot make a mistake
    - Defense often does not know the goals and tactics of the offense
- We need to think like the adversaries
- You do not need to know how they gain access, nor do you need to be a cyber expert
- If you approach your solutions asking, “What if they had access?” then
    - small design changes could make it harder for a cyber enabled adversary to be successful


### Who is the Adversary?
- Skill
    - Script kiddies
    - Amateur
    - Professional
- Tools
    - Computers/software
    - Social engineering
    - Physical access


### How are they organized
- Individual
- Cause based
- Loose collective
- As a business
- State based
    - State supported
    - State sponsored
    - State run


### Attributes
- Creative
- Patient
- Persuasive
- Opportunistic
- Determined
- Cooperative


### Adversaries' Objectives
- Interrelated and tied to money

- **Monetary Theft**
    - Redirection/diversion
    - Account access
    - Purchasing
    - Fraud
    - Ransomware 
- **Data**
    - Types
        - Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
        - Records, operational and infrastructure plans
    - Threats
        - Disclosure
        - Reuse (ID theft, bank accounts)
        - First step to another attack
    - Holding it hostage for money
- **Disruption**
    - Physical services
        - Power, traffic, water, gas
        - Building control, medical
    - IT services
        - 911, communications
        - Medical, government services
    - Holding it hostage for money
- **Terror**
    - Personal attacks (often demanding money)
        - Swatting
        - Fake messages: kidnapping, family arrested
        - Direct threats
    - Public attacks to cause fear
        - Disruption / ransom = Terror. 
        - The sole purpose is not to gain money but to cause chaos and fear
- **Public Trust**
    - Attackers may have the goal of eroding trust in:
        - The government
        - Elected officials
        - Certain services
        - Elections
        - Company brands
