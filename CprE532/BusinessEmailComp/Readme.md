# Business Email Compromise


### Social Engineering: Vulnerable people
- Estimates are over 50% of data loss is from Social Engineering
- Phishing
    - Spear-Phishing
- Email attachments
    - Trojans
    - Viruses
- Web Sites
    - Drive-by
    - Directed


### Business email compromise (BEC):
The numbers
- https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf
- Search for IC3 2022 cyber crime report
- What is BEC/EAC:
- Difference is the victim: BEC targets businesses and EAC is individuals
- Methods are often the same

- Nearly 3 billion in 2022


### BEC – How does it work
- Threat actor inserts themselves into a relationship
    - Accessing a valid email account
    - Malware
    - Video calls (new attack)
- Threat actor starts a relationship
    - Fake email address
    - Phone call (bogus caller ID)
    - Text message


### BEC – Inserting into a relationship
- Accessing valid email
    - Password guessing
    - Phishing email (steal credentials, first step for other attacks)
    - Once you are “valid” you still need to groom the victim
- Malware

    - Use to gather information
- Video calls (new attack)
    - Pretend to be part of the company and enter a meeting

    - Email tags, scanners
- User education
    - Never underestimate the attackers ability to fool a user.
- Processes
    - Money transfers
    - Email uses


### Gaps
- Technical measures can help slow down these attacks the workforce must be trained to detect and mitigate attacks
- 3 level training plan:
    - 1. cybersecurity literacy (Cyber hygiene)
    - 2. Hands-on cyber security technical training
    - 3. Cyber planning exercises
