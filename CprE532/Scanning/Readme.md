# Scanning / Reconnaissance

- Stay invisible

### Header Scanning
- Invalid header format sent
    - But still get back response
- Can use response to determine information about device connecting to

### Protocol Scanning
- Responses to different valid messages
- May report different by which version
    - Additional (plugin) services may change responses


### Authentication Scanning
- Generally not in scanning/recon
- Can test to see if there exist authentication on open ports or services
- May use MAC or IP as authenticator


### Traffic Scanning 
- Not used 
- Generally just sniffing and flooding 
    - Can't sniff externally
    - Flooding is an attack

- One concept that isn't meaningful
    - Sent packet might be replicated internally
    - Get multiple responses back

### User Scanning
- Social Engineering 
    - Have gotten email information from footprinting
    - Phishing, trying to reveal information from employee 

### TCP Streams
- Create them in special way to avoid detection by defensive mechanisms
