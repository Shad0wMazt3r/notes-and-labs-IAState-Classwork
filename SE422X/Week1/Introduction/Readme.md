# Intro


### Jumps in cloud usage
- 9/11
- Covid

### Security from Using the Cloud 
- Multiple copies 
- Geographical Redundancy
- Hard to know where to attack 
- DDOS resistant by spawning servers and load balancing based on demand

### Microservices
- Company use to have one may service as one / few programs 
    - Does everything
    - Account management, handle transactions
- New is to break up each function to small services / programs
    - Run independently

### Final
- From quizzes and projects



# Start of Slides

### Definition
- NIST
- Model fo renabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configuable computing resources
- Can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort

## Characteristics

### On-demand self service 
- Provisioned without interactions with provider
- Automated

### Broad network access
- Access over internet providing platform independent access

### Resource Pooling
- Resources provided to serve multiple users using multi-tenancy 
- Multi-tenancy allows multiple users to use the same hardware/database

### Rapid Elasticity
- Resources can be provisioned rapidly and elastically
- Resources can be rapidly scaled up or down based on demand
- Rubber band idea

### Measured Service
- Resources provided to users on a pay-per-use model
- The usage is measured and the user is charged based on some specific metric
- Metrics
    - What to measure 
- Measurements
    - Answer to metrics
- Impossible to measure the software, but can measure the service
    - Basically meta-data regarding the software running like uptime or users

### Performance
- Provides improved performance for applications
- Resources available to applications can be scaled up or down based on the dynamic application workloads
- Increasing instances based on how many users for load balancing
- Measurements can show how many are needed

### Reduced Cost
- Cloud computing provides cost benefits for applications 
    - Resources can be provisioned as required dynamically
- Upfront investment purchase hardware to cover worst case requirements is avoided 


### Outsourced Management
- Allows the users to outsource the IT infrastructure requirements to external cloud providers
- Succession planning


### Reliability 
- Applications deployed in cloud computing environments have a higher reliability 
- The underlying IT infrastructure is professionally managed by the cloud service
- Multiple instances


### Multi-tenancy
- The multi-tenanted approach of the cloud allows multiple users to make use of the same shared resources
- In virtual multi-tenancy, computing and storage resources are shared among multiple users
- In organic multi-tenancy, every component in the system architecture is shared among multiple tenants
