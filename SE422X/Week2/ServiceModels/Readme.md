# Cloud Services

### Service Models
- Software as a Service (SaaS) 
    - Applications, management and UI provided over a network 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
    - Application development frameworks, operating systems and deployment frameworks 
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
    - Virtual computing, storage and network resource that can be provisioned on demand

- Looks at this a one big computer
    - Hardware (CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage) == IaaS 
    - OS is PaaS
    - Applications == SaaS
