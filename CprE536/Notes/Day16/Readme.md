# Mobile and App Forensics

### Airdrop
- Send nudes on a plane or hate messages 
- 60 meters 
- Sender to everyone or contacts
    - People won't know who if you send to everyone
    - Kinda anonymous
- Recieve from enveryone or contacts

### Poachers Video
- Shared video on facebook
- Police can track down person and get their device
- Video / images have meta data on device
- Show user/phone and the geolocation and timestamp
- Police can get this to track users


### Geolocation
- Colorado wife killed
- Husband says they were together
- Phone locations show they were not 

### App Store 
- Millions of apps
- Mostly google and apple default play stores
- No way for people to understand every app 
    - Security checking
- IAState creating toolkit to analyze android apps

### Mobile Forensics
- Cellebrite UFED
- Similar to encase
- Shows img as everything in hex
    - Can search for certain strings

### IAstate app approach
- Download the application files from the play stores
- Can analyze the code of application to understand the file formats it produces
- Examples 
    - May not standardize cordinates or meta data
    - Using time zone or UTC in report
    - Date time format

### Static Program Analysis
- View where program files are stored
- No longer have to search
- Decompile binary

### Challenges
- Mobiles apps
- Multiple entry points instead of just a main
- Go through many points and locations could be dynamic

### Process for android
- APK to App Code
- Forward analysis
    - Method invoking
    - Non-method invoking
- Get output file paths and data types


### Method invoking Statement
- IPC analysis
- Android API
    - File sync
    - Dynamic strings so not plaintext
    - Unsure how it will look (viewer can get idea)

### Dynamic Analysis Approach
- Running the program to see what it does
- Debugging modes
- Modifying code
