### Forensics
- Basic idea is that gathering information to understand what happened 
- Who did and other infromation or criminal reports

- Fingerprints 
    - Idea: Press hard on a smooth surface, the fingerprint is clear
    - Not always the case though
    - Hard to actually match fingerprints

- DNA
    - Works really well in simple scenarios with one persons blood
    - Difficult when multiple peoples blood mix

- My ideas from this is that it shows the messiness of forensics
- Circumstances can be cut and dry if person is messy
- Know what they are doing can make it difficult

### SODDI 
- Some Other Dude Did It - Passing the blame
- Trojan Defense - apply SODDI to tech
    - Idea: persons computer is used by cybercriminal
    - Malware compromises computer, becomes zombie 
    - Existence of contraband on personal computer by criminal
- Deepfakes
    - Hard to tell that it isn't actually the real person
    - Analysis can come by analyzing other parts of the video
- Bitcoin 
    - Hard to trace payments, some ways 
    - Zero cost transaction
    - Used by criminals
    - 94% crypto money laundering is bitcoin
    - Ransom/Ransomware

### Mobile Forensics 
- Texts / Phone calls plus meta data
- GPS coordinates
- Pictures on phone
- Location outside GPS
    - Cell tower communications
    - Know when a phone connects and disconnects from cell towers to track general location
    - Know that phone are in proximity of one another to confirm people are together
