### Service Providers
- ISP supports other ISPs
    - Make sure if you are going redundant that they are on main ISPs
    - Small ISPs will just link you to a bigger one 
    - If big one goes down, all the small ones do as well (bad for reduncancy)
- Backbone
    - High bandwidth providers
- Cell
    - Some stuff still hooks into phone lines
    - Or just use their facilities 
- ISPs providing security
    - At the end point
    - Never really within their networks or how you go to the internet

### Internet
- This is a giant black box
- Attacks
    - Backhoe
        - Look into
    - Country tricks BGP to have traffic go through their devices
        - Scan the traffic and IDK profit if a few people mess up

### Critical Addresses for Class
- HW
- IP 
- Port
- These are all created by the host system
- The src device sets all of these things

- User ID 
- Set by the application 

### Address Spoofing
- Machine has full control to set addresses how they like
- HW, IP, port, user 
    - both src and dst
    - dst needs to be correct to go somewhere
    - Trying to fool dst and say that you are different src
