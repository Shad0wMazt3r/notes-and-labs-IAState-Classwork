### Authentication
- User authentication over the network
- Password guessing using POP or IMAP
    - Internal authentication to the software 
    - Instant connection on open telnet connection
- Every attempt can be logged
- Restrict POP and IMAP authentication to known IP addresses
- Use web client for remote access

### Traffic
- Flooding is not much of an issue
- Sniffing is an issue as not encrypted
    - There are encrypted versions of both IMAP and POP
