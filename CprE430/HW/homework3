The client-server model, where a client application (an application requesting a service or resources) talks to a server application (an application waiting for another application to connect to it), is used throughout the Internet. This is an important concept in networking and will be referenced throughout the semester.  

What are the four pieces of information used to uniquely identify each client-server connection (from the user/client point-of-view)?

Client IP Address (local address)
Client Port
Correct answer:
Server Port


The DNS system is laid out in a tree structure with a set of root DNS servers that have knowledge about the location of all of the first-level domain servers. This means root servers are the servers at the root of the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy. Using information gathered from the Internet, how many root name server IP addreses* are there?

*Note: This number does not represent the number of physical servers. There are many instances of root servers to ensure reliability and redundancy.
Correct answer:
13
